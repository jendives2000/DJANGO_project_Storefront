# WHAT I LEARNT

This repo is the 2nd repo of the same project. The first repo got deleted because I started it with an Anaconda virtual environment, and once I had to introduce MySQL to the project, Anaconda turned out to be non-reliable. I knew Anaconda is more skewed toward Data science and ML but I had no idea it was reluctant toward MySQL.  
Lesson learnt on my side. 

#### PROJECT DETAILS:  

VENV Manager: pipenv  
Python: v3.11  
Database: MySQL + DataGrip

## Introduction to MYSQL

Here I only just touched the surface of Databases. Installing MYSQL and DataGrip and creating a new database in DataGrip.  
Why DataGrip? Just because the course I am following is using it. But MYSQL Workbench is an alternative (though less optimal, according to the course).
